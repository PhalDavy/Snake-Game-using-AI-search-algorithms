# Snake-Game-using-AI-search-algorithms

### Objective 

A snack game using AI search algorithms involves guiding a player to collect snacks while avoiding obstacles. The AI uses algorithms like A* or BFS to find the optimal path, considering the positions of snacks and obstacles. This approach showcases how AI efficiently navigates and solves complex problems in dynamic environments.
